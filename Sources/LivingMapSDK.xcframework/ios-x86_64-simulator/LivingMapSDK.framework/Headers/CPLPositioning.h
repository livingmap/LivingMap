/**
 * Reset location based on a known location. This will be used for changing floors or grids.
 * Known location is used to determine which grid to use if there is more than one grid per floor.
 * If already using the correct grid, then the particles will be reinitialised around the known location.
 * @param init_location - this is used firstly to determine which floor's grid should be used. It does not need to be
 *        'valid', i.e. with coordinates, but these should be set if there is a recent location available. If no
 *        coordinates are provided, then there will be a full-grid initialisation.
 * @param allow_full_grid_initialization - allow full grid initialization if the initial location is invalid and
 *        cannot be used.
 *        If set to true, then a full-grid initialisation will take place and the function will return true.
 *        If set to false, then *no* full-grid initialisation will take place and the function will return false.
 *        Typically, you will want to set this to false if you have an alternative positioning method to use, and true if
 *        you have no choice but to let the CPL find a location after several iterations with a full-grid reset.
 * @param use_nearest_entry_point - find the nearest entry point to the given location, and use it if it is within the
 *        initialization range. This is useful for floor changes to re-adjust the location to the likely entry point
 *        on the new floor.
 * @param reachable_points_only - only distribute particles to points that can be reached from the given location,
 *        i.e. without going through a wall. This can be thought of like a 'flood fill' of the area.
 * @param initialization_range - if provided, will initialise particles in a circle with a radius of this value
 *        Default is 0 - the radius will be determined by the configuration parameter initialization_range_meters
 *        If using a location with an accuracy in metres, this can be used, but check the relevant documentation regarding
 *        the distribution of the accuracy value and set the sigma-rule accordingly. For example, in Android the accuracy
 *        represents 1 standard deviation in metres (the location will be within this distance 68% of the time). In Apple
 *        Core Location, however, the value is said to represent 3 standard deviations (the location will be within the
 *        distance 99.7% of the time).
 * @param sigma_rule - if set to 0, use a uniform distribution for the new particles, otherwise use a normal distribution
 *        where the given sigma-rule applies to the initialization_range.
 * @return true if the location was reset successfully, false otherwise
